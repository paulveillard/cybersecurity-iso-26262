## 1 - Introduction to ISO 26262
ISO 26262 is a standard for implementing functional safety measures for electric systems in an automotive vehicle. The first version of ISO 26262 was released in 2011. This version only covered functional safety for passenger cars. 
> A later edition of the standard, released in 2018, extended the scope to include all road vehicles except for mopeds.

### `1.1 - Discover ISO 26262`
Ensure your automotive software meets the highest safety standards by mastering ISO 26262 verification requirements and avoid critical, costly recalls by guaranteeing road-ready reliability.

- ISO 26262 is divided into 12 parts.

### `1.2 - What is Functional Safety?`

Safety can be defined by referring to two existing safety standards:
- **IEC 61508 (International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), a functional safety standard for the general electronics market developed by the IEC.**
  - IEC 61508 Definition:
> Safety is the freedom from unacceptable risk of physical injury or of damage to the health of people, either directly, or indirectly as a result of damage to property or to the
environment.
> Functional Safety is part of the overall safety that depends on a system or equipment operating correctly in response to its inputs.


- **ISO 26262 (IEC), a functional safety standard for automobiles from ISO. It has rapidly gaining acceptance as the guideline for the automotive engineer since its release.***
   - ISO 26262 Definition:
> Absence of unacceptable risk due to hazards caused by mal-functional behavior of electrical and/or electronic systems and the interactions of these systems.








##### Random Failures
− Result from random defects or soft errors inherent to process or usage condition
− Rate of random faults cannot generally be reduced; focus must be on the detection and handling of random faults to prevent application failure
