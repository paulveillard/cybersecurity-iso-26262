## 1 - Introduction to ISO 26262
ISO 26262 is a standard for implementing functional safety measures for electric systems in an automotive vehicle. The first version of ISO 26262 was released in 2011. This version only covered functional safety for passenger cars. 
> A later edition of the standard, released in 2018, extended the scope to include all road vehicles except for mopeds.

The **ISO 26262 series of standards** is the adaptation of **IEC 61508 series of standards** to address the sector specific needs of electrical and/or electronic (E/E) systems within road vehicles. 
This adaptation applies to all activities during the safety lifecycle of safety-related systems comprised of electrical, electronic and software components.
> Safety is one of the key issues in the development of road vehicles. Development and integration of automotive functionalities strengthen the need for functional safety and the need to provide evidence that functional safety objectives are satisfied. With the trend of increasing technological complexity, software content and mechatronic implementation, there are increasing risks from systematic failures and random hardware failures, these being considered within the scope of functional safety.

- ISO 26262 series of standards includes guidance to mitigate these risks by providing appropriate requirements and processes. To achieve functional safety, the ISO 26262 series of standards:
   - a) provides a reference for the automotive safety lifecycle and supports the tailoring of the activities to be performed during the lifecycle phases, i.e., development, production, operation, service and decommissioning;
   - b) provides an automotive-specific risk-based approach to determine integrity levels [Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs)]; iTeh STANDARD PREVIEW (standards.iteh.ai)
   -  c) uses ASILs to specify which of the requirements of ISO 26262 are applicable to avoid unreasonable residual risk;
   -  d) provides requirements for functional safety management, design, implementation, verification, validation and confirmation measures; and ISO 26262-1:2018 htps:/standards.iteh.ai/catalog/standards/sist/c1a72b85-fd93-4952-bc1e38aedd5d0742/iso-26262-1-2018
   -  e) provides requirements for relations between customers and suppliers.

### `1.1 - Discover ISO 26262`
Ensure your automotive software meets the highest safety standards by mastering ISO 26262 verification requirements and avoid critical, costly recalls by guaranteeing road-ready reliability.

- ISO 26262 is divided into 12 parts.

### `1.2 - What is Functional Safety?`

Safety can be defined by referring to two existing safety standards:
- **IEC 61508 (International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), a functional safety standard for the general electronics market developed by the IEC.**
  - IEC 61508 Definition:
> Safety is the freedom from unacceptable risk of physical injury or of damage to the health of people, either directly, or indirectly as a result of damage to property or to the
environment.
> Functional Safety is part of the overall safety that depends on a system or equipment operating correctly in response to its inputs.


- **ISO 26262 (IEC), a functional safety standard for automobiles from ISO. It has rapidly gaining acceptance as the guideline for the automotive engineer since its release.***
   - ISO 26262 Definition:
> Absence of unacceptable risk due to hazards caused by mal-functional behavior of electrical and/or electronic systems and the interactions of these systems.
