### `What is Functional Safety?`

- ISO 26262 Definition:
> Absence of unacceptable risk due to hazards caused by mal-functional behavior of electrical and/or electronic systems and the interactions of these systems

- IEC 61508 Definition:
> Safety is the freedom from unacceptable risk of physical injury or of damage to the health of people, either directly, or indirectly as a result of damage to property or to the
environment.
> Functional Safety is part of the overall safety that depends on a system or equipment
operating correctly in response to its inputs.

### Functional Safety Basic Concepts
- All systems will have some inherent, quantifiable failure rate. It is not possible to develop a system with zero failure rate.
- For each application, there is some tolerable failure rate which does not lead to unacceptable risk.
- Acceptable failure rates vary per application, based on the potential for direct or indirect physical injury in the event of system malfunction.
- The hazards and risks of applications can be analyzed and assigned categories based on the level of acceptable risk. These categories are known as Safety Integrity Levels, or SILs.
